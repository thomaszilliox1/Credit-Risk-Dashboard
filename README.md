# Dashboard Development & Technical Monitoring

This project focuses on presenting my data science work through interactive dashboards and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in Data Science and AI. It includes two key components: creating a client-facing dashboard for decision-making and conducting technical monitoring to evaluate new tools and methodologies.
 
## Key Skills Acquired:

- Dashboard Development: Building interactive and user-friendly dashboards for data presentation using Streamlit or Flask.
- Cloud Deployment: Deploying dashboards to the cloud for external accessibility.
- API Integration: Exposing model results through APIs for use in the dashboard.
- Technical Monitoring: Researching and evaluating the latest tools and trends in Data Science and AI to improve model performance.
- Communication & Reporting: Presenting modeling work and results clearly to non-technical stakeholders and writing methodological reports.

## Technologies Used:

- Streamlit / Flask: Building and deploying interactive dashboards.
- Python: Data manipulation, dashboard development, and integration.
- GitHub: Code versioning and sharing, including cloud-based deployments.
- APIs: Exposing results to dashboards and users through custom-built APIs.
- Technical Research: Keeping track of new tools and technologies in the field of Data Science and AI.
